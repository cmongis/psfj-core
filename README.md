# PSFj - Core
Know your microscope fluorescence

PSFj-Core is a new attempt of separating PSFj into different interconnected entities, along with a migration to a Maven dependency model.

This library only contains the necessary libraries for executing analysis of 3D image stacks and generate the report.
This module is still under developement and separate from the main PSFj code base. If you want to try the normal PSFj, please visit PSFj website [http://www.knoplab.de/psfj/](http://www.knoplab.de/psfj) or its code base [https://github.com/cmongis/psfj](https://github.com/cmongis/psfj)
